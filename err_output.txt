Feature: Add and delete elections
  As a admin
  I want to be able to add elections and delete elections
  So that I can start elections and end elections

  Background:                        # features/add-delete_election.feature:6
    Given I am logged in as an admin # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:303
    And I see "Hello,"               # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:325

  Scenario: Add election                                     # features/add-delete_election.feature:10
    Given I am on the show elections page for an admin       # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:48
    And I should see "Add election"                          # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:109
    When I press "Add election"                              # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:56
    And I add the election called "election1"                # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:260
      CSUA is 4
      election1 is 8
      election2 is 0
    Then I should be on the show elections page for an admin # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:234
    And I should see "Add election"                          # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:109
      #When I am on the election list page
    Then I should see "election1"                            # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:109
      expected to find text "election1" in "Add organization Add election Settings" (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)
      ./features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:111:in `/^(?:|I )should see "([^"]*)"$/'
      features/add-delete_election.feature:18:in `Then I should see "election1"'
    Then I should see "New election name:"                   # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:109
    Then I should see "Add position"                         # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:109
    Then I log out                                           # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:329
