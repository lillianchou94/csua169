WARNING: Cucumber-rails required outside of env.rb.  The rest of loading is being deferred until env.rb is called.
  To avoid this warning, move 'gem 'cucumber-rails', :require => false' under only group :test in your Gemfile.
  If already in the :test group, be sure you are specifying ':require => false'.
